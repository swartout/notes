# Magic the Gathering

## May 1

I've always loved Magic - it's a perfect mixture of strategy, bluffing, and
probability (in other words, an even nerdier version of poker). For as long as
I've enjoyed this game I've always been infatuated with optimal play. I'd read
a column called "What's The Play", detailing a challenging in-game situation
and try to deduce the perfect play. While playing optimally has been
challenging for me, it's even more difficult for computers. Sparky, the AI
opponent players play against during the MTG Arena tutorial is terrible,
lacking situational understanding and often playing at near random. (It would
be a grave insult to say a player played like Sparky.) I'm going to implement a
toy game engine for Magic (similar to the OpenAI Gym) and run experiments using
reinforcement learning. A major challenge for AI agents playing Magic has been
the textual nature of the game: cards are written in natural language, making
new or complex cards challenging for a handcrafted policy. With the strength
of modern LLMs, I'm interested if states could be modeled from a natural language
input. While this might be infeasible, I'm incredibly curious!

In the past I've had challenges following through with projects once other responsibilities
creep into my life. I'm hoping that by writing about this on a public-facing site I'll
stay more accountable and maintain better organization. I hope to put a couple hours into
this every few days and write about it here.
