## Lecture 1 - March 27

- We will cover probability, combinatorics, and some applications
- Counting is helpful because:
    - It helps with algo analysis
    - It is a building block for probability
- A set's cardinality (size) is the number of distinct elements in it
- *Sum Rule:* if we want to choose an element between two sets with no overlapping elements, we have the sum of the cardinalities number of options
- *Product Rule:* when we have a sequential process of choosing elements, the number of possibilities is the sum of the number of options *at each step*
    - This is equal to the size of the Cartesian Product of the sets
    - Note that is works independent of which are the elements being chosen from, as long as the number of options is always the same at a step
- What is the size of the power set of $S$?
    - $2^{\mid S \mid}$
    - Like the product rule, as each element can be in or out of a subset

## Lecture 2 - March 29

- When parsing HW problems, look out for "sequence" and "distinct"
- Remember $0! = 1$
- **K Permutation:**
    - The number of $k$ element sequences of distinct symbols from a universe of $n$ symbols is: $P(n, k) = n (n - 1) \dots (n - k + 1) = \frac{n!}{(n - k)!}$
    - Said as "P n K", "n permute k", or "n pick k"
- Permutation vs subsets: does order matter?
- **K Combination:**
    - The number of $k$ element subsets from a set of $n$ symbols is: $C(n, k) = \frac{P(n, k)}{k!} = \frac{n!}{k!(n - k)!}$
    - Said as "n choose k" typically
    - Also written as: $\binom{n}{k}$
    - We can think of this as finding the number where ordering matters, then dividing by the number of possible orders for each subset
- We can go back and forth from combinations to permutations by dividing and multiplying by the number of possible orders within a subset (typically $\mid S \mid$)
- Path counting is really just combinations
- Overcounting is cool! (We just have to correct for it)
    - e.g. anagrams of "SEATTLE", we find all permutations, then divide by the product of the factorials of the number of each element
        - divide by $2! \cdot 2!$
- **Complementary Counting:**
    - We count all the *complements* of a set (everything that *wouldn't* be valid), then subtract that from the cardinality of the universe!

## Lecture 3 - April 1

- **Multinomial coefficient:** $\binom{c}{a, b} \equiv \frac{c!}{a! \cdot b!}$
- Counting two ways can be a good way to learn more and understand!
- **Symmetry of combinations:** $\binom{n}{k} = \binom{n}{n - k}$
    - Can prove using algebra
    - Can prove using the "team-picking" idea: choosing who is on a team also indirectly chooses who is not on a team, and vice-versa
- **Pascal's Rule:** $\binom{n}{k} = \binom{n - 1}{k - 1} + \binom{n - i}{k}$
    - Again, we can prove using algebra
    - We can also prove using the idea of the summation of all teams that I'm on and teams that I'm not on
        - "Focus on one element"
- **Binomial Theorem:** $(x + y)^n = \sum_{i = 0}^{n} \binom{n}{i} x^i y^{n-1}$
    - We have $xy$'s and $\binom{n}{i}$ determines how many there are
    - Useful when we need to plug in specific numbers for x and y
- **Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion:** when we are trying to get the size of a set which is the OR of multiple conditions, we can take the size of the union of the sets which satisfy at least one condition
    - Sum rule for non-disjoint sets: $\mid A \cup B \mid = \mid A \mid + \mid B \mid - \mid A \cap B \mid$
    - Sum rule for three non-disjoint sets follows similar logic, subtracting the intersection of each pair of sets, then adding the intersection of all sets
    - Typically only use for two or three conditions (maybe four)

## Lecture 4 - April 3

- Pigeonhole Principle
    - If there are more items then spots, we know that one spot has more than one item
    - Strong Pigeonhole: If we have $n$ pigeons and $k$ pigeonholes, there is at least one pigeonhole with $\frac{k}{n}$ pigeons, *rounded up*
- Placing dividers (stars and bars):
    - If we need to find the number of different groups comprised of different types of elements, use dividers
    - For n size groups of k types: $\binom{n+k-1}{k-1}$
    - Can think about it as a binary string permutation problem

## Lecture 5 - April 5

- Probability is a way of quantifying our uncertainty
- Sample space, $\Omega$, is all the possible outcomes of an experiment
    - Single coin flip: $\Omega = \lbrace H, T \rbrace$
- An event, $E \subseteq \Omega$, is a subset of all possible outcomes
- A probability, $\mathbb{P}: \Omega \rightarrow [0, 1]$, is a function that maps an element of $\Omega$ to it's likelihood of occurring
    - Other notation: $Pr[\omega]$ or $P(\omega)$
    - All probabilities must be between 0 and 1 and the sum of the probability for each element in the sample space must sum to 1
    - Probability of an event should be the sum of the probabilities of the elements in the event
- A probability space is a pair of sample space and probability function
- Uniform Probability Space: all events have the same likelihood
- Events are "mutually exclusive" if they cannot happen simultaneously
- Axioms:
    - Non-negativity: $\mathbb{P}(x) \geq 0$ for all $x$
    - Normalization: $\sum_{x \in \Omega} \mathbb{P}(x) = 1$
    - Countable additivity: If $E$ and $F$ are mutually exclusive, then: $\mathbb{P}(E \cup F) = \mathbb{P}(E) + \mathbb{P}(F)$
- Facts derived from axioms:
    - Complementation: $\mathbb{P}(\bar{E}) = 1 - \mathbb{P}(E)$
    - Monotonicity: if $E \subseteq F$, then $\mathbb{P}(E) \leq \mathbb{P}(F)$
    - Inclusion-exclusion: $\mathbb{P}(E \cup F) = \mathbb{P}(E) + \mathbb{P}(F) - \mathbb{P}(E \cap F)$

## Lecture 6 - April 7

- Often our sample space will contain excess information. This won't make our answer incorrect, but can lead to unnecessary work
- We use conditional probability when we have partial information
    - It is a way to "restrict" the sample space
    - $\mathbb{P}(A \mid B) = \frac{\mathbb{P}(A \cap B)}{\mathbb{P}(B)}$
    - This allows us to update our probabilities
    - "The probability of A given B is equal to the probability of A and B happening, divided by the probability of B"
- Intro to Bayes' Rule
---

## Lecture 7 - April 10

- Bayes' Rule allows us to use conditional probabilities
- Bayes Rule:
    - $\mathbb{P}(A \mid B) = \frac{\mathbb{P}(B \mid A) \mathbb{P}(A)}{\mathbb{P}(B)}$
- The law of total probability:
    - $\mathbb{P}(S) = \mathbb{P}(S \mid G) \cdot \mathbb{P}(G) + \mathbb{P}(S \mid \bar{G}) \cdot \mathbb{P}(\bar{G})$
    - More generally: $\sum_{\forall i}\mathbb{P}(E \mid A_i) \mathbb{P}(A_i)$
    - The probability of an event happening is equal to the sum of the probability of the event happening given another event happening, multiplied by the probability of the other event
- A partition of the sample space is a family of subsets where each partition is distinct and they combine to be the entire sample space
- Humans are very bad at understanding very large or small numbers - past a certain amount we ignore magnitudes
- It is good to think of tests as an "update" to our priors, not a revelation of truth
- When we condition on an event, we still have probability spaces: $B$ and probability measures: $\mathbb{P}(\omega \mid B)$
- Do *not* condition on multiple events, only the intersection of them

## Lecture 8 - April 12

- (Statistical) independence is when the probabilities of two things don't depend on each other:
    - $\mathbb{P}(A \cap B) = \mathbb{P}(A) \cdot \mathbb{P}(B)$
    - "Conditioning doesn't make a difference"
- Chain Rule:
    - $\mathbb{P}(A_1 \cap A_2 \cap \dots \cap A_n) = \mathbb{P}(A_n \mid A_1 \cap \dots \cap A_{n-1}) \cdot \mathbb{P}(A_{n-1} \mid A_1 \cap \dots \cap A_{n-2}) \dots \mathbb{P}(A_2 \mid A_1) \cdot \mathbb{P}(A_1)$
    - We can find this from: $\mathbb{P}(A \mid B) = \frac{\mathbb{P}(A \cap B)}{\mathbb{P}(B)} \rightarrow \mathbb{P}(A \cap B) = \mathbb{P}(A \mid B) \cdot \mathbb{P}(B)$
- Conditional independence is independence of two events given another event
