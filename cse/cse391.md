# CSE 391

---

## Lecture 1 - June 20

- Need 14/18 points to pass
- SSH basics: `username@server`
- Unix: developed in the late 60s at Bell Labs
    - Everything is a file!
- Linux: developed in 1992 by Linus
- Why use the CLI? It is often faster and easier!
- `/bin` is where the binaries are stored
- `ls -lh` lists everything in `h`uman-readable format
- We can use the `find` command to *find* files!
    - Starts in your current directory, recursivly searches from there
    - `-name` matches the end of each path
- `man`: manual for commands

---

## Lecture 2 - June 27

- Shell expands all `*` wildcards
- `cat`: con`cat`enate a file to the terminal
- `less`: allows easy viewing of text vim-like
- `head`: print the first lines of a file
- `tail`: print the last lines of a file
    - `-f` flag to keep running file
- `wc`: word count program
    - by default, counts lines, words, then characters
- `sort`: sorts lines alphabetically
- `uniq` collapses adjacent unique lines
    - Typically should `sort` it first
- `grep`: search tool for files
    - First argument is search term, proceding arguments are files to search from
    - Prints each line that matches the search term
- Running java on the command line:
    - `javac ProgramName.java` combiles the program
    - `javac ProgramName` runs the program
    - `java ProgramName.java` compiles and runs the program
- Streams:
    - Standard input: `stdin`
    - Standard output: `stdout`
    - Standard error: `stderr`
- Reads or adds to the *stream* however much is requested
- Use the right waka `>` to redirect standard output to a file
    - Double waka `>>` appends standard output to a file
- Use the left waka `<` to redirect standard input from a file
- Use two waka `2>` to redirect standard error to a file
- Pipes `|`: takes standard output of what's on the left and uses it as standard input on the right
    - Used to chain commands together
- `ctrl-D` to close a program

## Lecture 3 - July 4

- `command1 && command2` runs `command2` if `command1` ran successfully
    - Similar to short-circuting evaluations
- `command1 || command2` runs `command2` if `command1` didn't run successfully
- `command1 ; command2` always runs both commands
- Some commands don't read from standard input if none are provided
    - `xargs`: "negotiate" between standard input and passing parameters
    - Command substitution: evaluate what's in a `$(eval)` and substitute
- Append `&1` to use the same as standard output (not as confident)
- `tee` saves standard output to a file *while* still printing it out
- `echo` echos what is passed
- `cut`: cuts up input:
    - `-cRANGE` outputs the RANGE of characters
    - `-dDELIMETER` cuts at the delimeter
    - `-fRANGE` outputs the RANGE of fields
- Standard output and input is buffered, use `stdbuf` to change behavior

## Lecture 4 - July 11

- A repo stores the state (and history) of the project
    - Don't store the compiled files, build somewhere else
- Using a remote repository allows us to have a unified source of truth
- `git status`: display the status of the repo
    - Only working directory and staging area
- `git commit -m "message"`: commits the staged files with the message
- The four stages of git:
    1. Working directory: the local files on your computer
    2. Staging area/idex: changes I'm preparing to commit
    3. Local repository: project changes on my computer
    4. Remote repository: shared and source of truth
- `git add` to add files
- `git log` to view past commits
    - Each commit gets its own hash
    - Use `--decorate --all --graph` to get a visual history of the repository
- `origin master` is where the computer thinks the remote repository is at
- `HEAD` is where we are locally
- `git restore file` to remove local changes
    - Add `--staged` flag to un-stage
- The diffs for files are what is actually tracked, that means a file can be both staged and have unstaged diffs
- `git diff` allows us to view differences between working directory and staging area
    - Add `--staged` flag to view diff between staging area and local repository
- `git help command` displays the man page for `git command`
- `git commit` (no `-m`) allows you to add a commit message on first line, then other info on other lines
- `git pull` "pulls" the remote commits to your local repository
    - Often leads to a "merge commit"
- `git switch -c name` to create a branch and switch to it
