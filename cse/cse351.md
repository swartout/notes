# CSE 351

---

## Lecture 1 - June 21

- We will cover three main topics:
    - Data
    - Programs
    - Scale
- The prefix for binary is: `0b`, hex prefix is: `0x`
- With $n$ binary digits we can represent $2^n$ things
    - With $n$ digits of base $b$ we can represent $b^n$ things
- ASCII characters are one byte, representing 256 characters
    - lol we have so much more memory now, hello UTF encoding

---

## Lecture 2 - June 23

- The CPU executes instructions which are also stored in memory
- CSE 351 is about data movement - how is memory stored or found?
- Base-2 is the default (although DNA/quantum computing is researched)
- We manipulate memory as chunks of bytes (even if it doesn't need all bits - hello bools!)
- Definition "word": a 8-byte chunk of memory
- x86-64 systems use 64-bit words
    - The potential address space is 2^64 addresses
- Pointers are also stored in memory like any other data
- Big-endian: least signifcant byte stored in the *largest* address
    - Not commonly used
- Little-endian: least significant byte stored in *smallest* address
    - x86, x86-64
- Bi-endian (used on ARM/M1)
- The pointer always points to the lowest address of the data

---

## Lecture 3 - June 26

- Pointers are defined: `type* ptr;`
    - The `type` encodes size information, the `*` designates it is a pointer
- To get the address of a variable, write: `type* ptr = &var;`
    - The address must be stored in a pointer
- The "dereference" operator `*` is used to "grab" the data a pointer points to
    - i.e. `int num = *ptr;`
- `NULL` is a special pointer to nothing
- Addition of a pointer and a scalar scales the scalar by the size of the type
- Subtraction of two pointers the value is scaled (divided) by the size of the type
    - We can use this to find the amount of `type`s between two pointers
- Arrays are sets of contiguous locations in memory that store the same type of data object
    - C declaration: `type name[size]`
    - Indexing actually works with: `*(array_name + n)`
- "Strings" in C are actually just arrays of chars terminated by the null character
    - i.e. `char str[] = "hi"` allocates an array of size three
    - Null character is backslash 0
        - not every array in C has this null character
- In C, declaration does *not* mean initialization: there can be garbage data

---

## Lecture 4 - June 28

- `0` is false, everything else is true
- Bitwise operators:
    - AND: `&`
    - OR:  `|`
    - XOR: `^`
    - NOT: `~`
- Logical operators:
    - AND: `&&`
    - OR:  `||`
    - NOT: `!`
- Unsigned integers work as expected
- Signed integers use: *Two's Complement*
    - The weight of the most significant bit is negative
    - This means `-x == ~x + 1`
- Bitmasking allows us to change our inputs as we want

---

## Lecture 5 - June 30

- Signed/unsigned integers are represented in memory the same way
- Type casting includes:
    - Changes in bit-widths
    - Changes in interpretation
    - Full changes in representations
- Implicit casting happens when there is a type mismatch, but a well defined conversion between the two types
- Explicit casts: `(new_type) expression`
- When casting between bit-widths, we must extend the data
    - Zero extension: padding with extra zeros on the left (preserves the value)
    - Sign extension: pad signed data with copies on most signficant bit (preserves sign and value)
- Operations between signed and unsigned values implicitly cast all values to unsigned representations
- Fixed-with binary arithmatic is modular
    - This results in integer overflow
- Bit shifting: move all bits a specified amount in a direction, filling in what is lost
    - Left shift: `x << n` fills in `n` zeros on the right
    - Logical right shift: `x >> n` where `x` is unsigned, fills in zeros on the left
    - Arithmetic right shift: `x >> n` where `x` is signed, fills in with copies of most significant bit on the left
- Bit shifting can be interpreted as integer multiplication or division by powers of two
- To force unsigned ints, we must append number with `u` or `U`

## Lecture 6 - July 5

- Masking in C: `#define SEARCH replace`
- IEEE 754 floating point encoding uses *normalized scientific binary notation*:
    - This includes the sign, mantissa, and exponent
    - 32 and 64 bit encodings for float and long
- Sign is represented using just a single bit
- Exponent is biased notation:
    - The value is shifted by: $2^{w - 1} - 1$ where $w$ is the width of the exponent field
    - Bias is a zero followed by all ones: `0b01...1`
    - Bias is an unsigned int
    - Positive is one bigger
- Mantissa:
    - Implicit leading one: $1.M$, not actually stored
    - Can lead to [weird rounding errors](https://0.30000000000000004.com)
- 32 bit encoding (float):
    - first bit is sign
    - next 8 bits are exponent
    - last 23 bits are mantissa
- 64 bit encoding (long):
    - first bit is sign
    - next 11 bits are exponent
    - last 52 bits are mantissa
- Steps to go from FP -> decimal:
    1. Append the bits of $M$ to implicit leading 1 to form the mantissa.
    2. Multiply the mantissa by $2^{\text{E - bias}}$
    3. Multiply the sign $(-1)^{\text{S}}$
    4. Multiply out the exponent by shifting the binary point.
    5. Convert from binary to decimal.
- Steps to go from decimal -> FP:
    1. Convert decimal to binary.
    2. Convert binary to normalized scientific notation.
    3. Encode the sign as $S$ (0 or 1).
    4. Encode $E$ as exponent + bias in unsigned.
    5. Encode the 23 bits after the binary point (padding with trailing 0's as needed) into $M$
- Precision is the number of bits in a computer word to represent a value
    - Gives capacity for accuracy
- Accuracy is a measure of the difference between the true and computer representations of a value
- If the exponent and mantissa are zeros, the float is zero
- If the exponent is all ones and mantissa is zero, it is positive or negative zero
- If the exponent is all ones and mantissa is *not* zero, it is not a number (`NaN`)
    - The mantissa will store some value about what went wrong
- When the exponent is zero and the mantissa is *not* zero, we have denormalized numbers
    - This fills in the gaps between 0 and a real number
- FP errors:
    - Overflow: exp too large
    - Underflow: exp too small
    - Rounding: between possible numbers

## Lecture 7 - July 7

- Instruction set architecture (ISA) is the processor spec necessary to write assembly code
    - System state: all information that defines culmination of past instructions
    - Instruction set: list and format of all instructions the CPU can execute
    - The effect on the system state of each instruction
- The spectrum of ISAs falls between CISC and RISC:
    - CISC: complex instruction set computer, easy for programmers but harder for hardware
    - RISC: reduced instruction set computer, easier for hardware but low-level programming
- x86-64 is CISC, we will only look at integral data and use "AT&T" syntax
- In x86-64 assembly, instructions are specified using a short instruction name followed by 0-3 operands
    - We will primarily look at instructions with 1-2 operands
    - "AT&T" syntax typically follows:
        - `instr op`
        - `instr src, dest`
- Main types of x86-64 instructions:
    - Data transfer: copy data from one place to another
    - Arithmetic and logical operations
    - Control flow
- Each instruction includes a "size specifier" letter appended:
    - `b` for byte
    - `w` word (two bytes)
    - `l` long word (4 bytes)
    - `q` quad word (8 bytes)
- `addb` does integer addition using a byte data width
- Operands for x86-64 are one of three types:
    1. Immediates: constant integer data, uses `$` prefix
    2. Registers: name of any of the 16 general purpose registers, uses `%` prefix
    3. Memory: specific address, ususally dereferenced, parenthesis before a `%`
- For binary instructions (two operands), the operations can be used in any combination *except:*
    - Immediate cannot be used as a destination operand
    - No memory to memory operation (both operations cannot be Memory)
- A register is a location in the CPU which stores small amount of data (word size) which can be accessed quickly
    - Fixed number per architecture
        - x86-64 has 16 with 8-byte word size
    - Referred by name, different for smaller divisions
    - Some registers are reserved
- Register names referring to smaller divisions always refer to *least significant bytes* of the register
    - `%ax` refers to the lowest two bytes of `%rax`
- When a smaller register name is used, the upper bytes are untouched **except:**
    - Any instruction that generates a 32-bit value for a register also sets the higher bits to all zeros (x86-64)
- General way to express Memory operand: `D(Rb,Ri,S)`
    - `D`: displacement value, must be an immediate or constant
    - `Rb`: base register, name of the register which acts as the "base" of our address calculation
    - `Ri`: index register, name of the register whos value will be scaled and added to the base
    - `S`: scale factor, scales the value in `Ri` by the specified number, must be 1, 2, 4, or 8
- The computed address is: `Reg[Rb] + Reg[Ri] \* S + D` where `Reg[]` means "the value in the register specified"
    - Most instructions will dereference this, giving the *memory* of this
- Default values of Memory operand:
    - `D = 0`
    - `Reg[Rb] = 0`
    - `Reg[Ri] = 0`
    - `S = 1`
- GCC and Clang can compile down to x86-64 or ARM instruction sets
- Assembly doesn't have "data types", only byte amounts
- "Moving" data actually is more similar to copying data

## Lecture 8 - July 10

- Calling conventions: for assembly functions
    - We store first argument in `%rdi`
    - We store second argument in `%rsi`
    - Return value is stored in `%rax`
- Addressing modes:
    - We can use parenthesis to dereference pointers i.e. `(%rax)`
- Remember registers can store pointers as well!
- `leaq src, dst`: load effective address
    - Breaks the rules :/
    - `src` is address expression
    - `dst` is a register
    - Sets `dst` to the address computed by the `src` expression
        - Only does math, doesn't do memory stuff
- As multiplication is an expensive operation, it is often broken down to bitshifts and additions
- `%rip` stores a pointer to the next instruction we will execute
- There are one bit "condition codes" which store one-bit of memory and are implicitly set
    - `CF` carry flag
    - `ZF` zero flag
    - `SF` sign flag
    - `OF` overflow flag
- Compare `cmpq a, b` sets condition codes by doing `b - a`
- `testq a, b` does the same, setting codes with `a&b`
    - `testq a, a` allows us to test based on an existing value
- `jmp` is unconditional
    - Updates `%rip`
- `set*` sets the lowest byte of a register to 0 or 1 based on current condition codes

## Lecture 9 - July 12

- Extension instructions: `movz` and `movs`
    - Similar to the `mov` command, but source operand is shorter than the dest operand
    - Performs `z`ero extension and `s`ign extension
    - Requires two width specifier suffixes
- Conditionals are typically made up of two instructions:
    1. Logical instruction that sets/changes the condition codes (`cmp`, `test`)
    2. A conditional jump instruction (`j*`)
- Operand to a jump instruction is a label
    - Name followed by a colon, i.e. `main:`
    - Labels are symbolic, representing the location of the next instruction found
- Loops are made by using a jump statement to go backwards to beginning of loop body
    - Conditionals can be at the top or bottom of the loop
- Switch statement branches condition depending on a value
    - Need to `break` to prevent falling through cases
    - Jump table has an "array" of pointers to code
    - Those code blocks are contiguous
- `ja`: jump to the default case (unsigned case)
- `jmp *.L4(,%rdi,8)`: jump table, index starting at `.L4`
