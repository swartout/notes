## Lecture 1 - Sept 27

- Stable matching: think about matching residents to hospitals
    - Unstable pair: two people prefer someone over their current partner
        - Applicant $x$ prefers hospital $y$ to their current one
        - Hospital $y$ prefers applicant $x$ to one of their own
    - Stable assignment: no unstable pairs
        - This is always prefered!
        - No joint action to switch partners
        - There is always a stable assignment
- Finding a stable matching is the stable matching problem
- Simple stable matching problem:
    - Two groups of $n$ people, match them
    - Participants rate members of each other group in order of preference
- Perfect matching: everyone is matched to prcisely one person from the other group
- Stable roommate problem, ranking within only one group
    - Stable matchings do not always exist
- Propose-And-Reject algorithm:
    - Proposer group, receiver group
    - Keep proposing until they get accepted
    - $O(n^2)$ based on the fact that proposals are never repeated
        - Once someone gets to the last person on their list, all of $r$ has been proposed to
        - As people in $r$ always stay together once proposed to, all of $r$ has a match
        - As all of $r$ has a match, all of $p$ also has a match!

## Lecture 2 - Sept 29

- Gale-Shapley algorithm will *always* find a stable matching
- Brute-force of stable matching is $O(n!)$
- How to implement (and make each iteration $O(1)$):
    - Maintain a list of free proposers
    - Maintain two arrays of matched proposers and recievers
    - Maintain an array of the number of times a proposer has proposed
    - Use an inverse list for the preferences of the recievers
        - $O(n^2)$ to create these
        - Switch indexes and values
- Proposer-optimal assignment: proposers get their best valid partner
- Gale-Shapley is proposer-optimal and reciever-pessimal
