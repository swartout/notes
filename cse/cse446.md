# CSE 446

## Lecture 1 - Sept 27

- ML algorithms attempt to *learn* decision rules, vs hardcoding them
- We reviewed basic prob
    - IID: independent, identically distributed
- Maximum likelihood estimation (MLE): argmax of a log, helps with derivation and scaling
- MLE Gaussian:
    - MLE of mean does not depend on var
    - MLE of var depends on the real mean
