# CSE 332

---

# Lecture 1 - June 21

- What this course is:
    - Classic data structurs and algos
    - Queues, dicts, graphs, sorting
    - Parallelism and concurrency (new! exciting!)
- Data structures are clever ways of storing information to perform efficent compututation
    - There are *always* tradeoffs with each option
- Abstract Data Type (ADT) is a mathematical description of a "thing" with a set of operations
- Data Structure: specific orginization of data and family of algos for implementing ADT
- Implementation: the actual concrete code
- We can use circular arrays or double-linked lists for queues
    - Both work!
