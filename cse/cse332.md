# CSE 332

---

## Lecture 1 - June 21

- What this course is:
    - Classic data structurs and algos
    - Queues, dicts, graphs, sorting
    - Parallelism and concurrency (new! exciting!)
- Data structures are clever ways of storing information to perform efficent compututation
    - There are *always* tradeoffs with each option
- Abstract Data Type (ADT) is a mathematical description of a "thing" with a set of operations
- Data Structure: specific orginization of data and family of algos for implementing ADT
- Implementation: the actual concrete code
- We can use circular arrays or double-linked lists for queues
    - Both work!

## Lecture 2 - June 23

- What do we care about? (DSA)
    1. Correctness - does it work?
    2. Performance - speed! (and memory)
- Evaluating the *program* is difficult - better to evaluate the *algorithm*
- Analyzing code: counting code constructs:
    - Basic operations (indexing, assignment): $\text{constant time}$
    - Loops: $\text{num iterations} \times \text{loop body}$
    - Conditionals: $\text{time of condition} + \text{slowest branch}$
    - Function calls: $\text{timee of functions body}$
    - Recursion: $\text{solve recurrence equation}$
- Complexity cases:
    - Worst-case complexity: max num of steps algo takes on "most challenging" input $n$
    - Best-case complexity: min num of steps algo takes on "easiest" input of size $n$
    - Average-case complexity: *what does "average" mean?*
    - Amortized-case complexity: we learn about this later
- Linear search, best case: $O(1)$, worst case: $O(n)$
- Asymptotic analysis: big $O$ notation
    - A function $f$ is in $O(\tilde{f})$ if $f$ and $\tilde{f}$ have the same asymptoic behavior
